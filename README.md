# Woofie's Rescue
Woofie's Rescue is a non-profit 501(c)3, volunteer-driven organization
in San Jose, CA devoted to rescuing dogs in high risk of euthanasia at
overcrowded shelters. We provide in-home fostering for the rescued dogs,
where they can play and socialize, be spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and
treated for any medical conditions. While they are in our care, we seek
out a match that suits the adopter and dog.
